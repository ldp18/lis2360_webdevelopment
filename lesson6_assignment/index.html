       <h2><em> Research</em></h2>
       
       <p> The Alzheimer's Association is a foundation founded in Illinois, but they raise awareness all of the United States. Alzheimer's is a disease that effects a persons memory. They can start out by forgetting small things, but as the disease progresses the person forgets everything. This can be anything from a persons name to turning off the stove before they leave the house. This association raises awareness by organizing events like 5k runs/races to a bike ride. They also passed an act which made fighting against Alzheimer's mandatory. They are the largest nonprofit research company ever for this disease.</p>
       <p> The research that has been done so far has come a long way. Scientists are now able to understand what the disease actually does to the brain. Alzheimer's is a disorder where brain cells die and cause the lose of a persons memory and the lose of cognitive funtions.The disease slowly breaks down the brain until the person is so far into the disease that it turns the brain into a mushy organ with no memory in the skull. Scientists have been able to come out with multipul medications to slow the progression of alzheimer's to buy them more time with their loved ones. There is still no official cure for this disease but the scientists are getting closer everyday to a final cure.</p>
       <p> Alzheimer's is a form of dimentia. This disease is the most common type of dementia to ever exist. This disease effected me on a personal level with my grandmother who ended up passing away in 2018. The symptoms described above are how it all starts. Once the disease progresses to a certain point the person becomes so forgetful that you have to take care of them on a 24/7 bases. They require all the help a young child would need but in adult form. The list of symptoms is never ending for these people. A person can experience their entire mood changing as the disease progresses and speech problems. A person can forget how to form a proper sentence or hesitating while talking becuase they are trying to remember the words they are trying to put together for a sentence.</p>
       <p> The National Alzheimer's Project Act was made to make the research on this disease mandatory by the government. This act also requires the government to fund research done by this organization. These funds by the government along with donations from people all over the United States has created the oportunity for scientists to doing testing on what the disease is and different medications that will continue to help slow down the disease and possible one that will end the disease all together. The funding that is provided also allows this company to create a figures and facts report when needed to educate family and congress on what this disease is and how hard it impacts the families.</p>
